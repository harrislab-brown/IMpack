## IMpack mechanical designs

This directory contains step files and native Fusion 360 design files for the IMpack itself as well as the fixtures we designed to hold it during testing which can serve as an example for user applications. The shaker mount was used to attach the IMpack to the mechanical shaker for frequency response testing. The threaded mount was used to hold the IMpack in the submerisble water impactor which produced the water entry data. The mounting geometry for the IMpack itself and the battery pocket are the same in both designs and should be replicated in a machined aluminum part if relying on our frequency response data. Note that the IMpack is designed for the plated ring around the outside perimeter of the board's bottom face to act as the mechanical mounting surface. For less sensitive applications or preliminary testing 3D printed parts will likely work fine.
